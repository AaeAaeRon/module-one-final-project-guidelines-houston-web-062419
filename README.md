The Simple Store Project 

At The Simple Store we utilize the Command Line Interface(CLI) to allow a user or "customer" to create an account and be able to read, update, and delete instances of purchases using ActiveRecord concepts. 
For this project, we decided to explore the scenario of a customer's purchase. There are three parts to the project, they are the customer, the item and the purchase(joiner). The customer has name and email address, the item has name and its' price, and the purchase has customer id, item id, quantity of each item purchased. 

The customer chooses the item they want to buy, information of the price, the name and price of item is passed on to the joiner class purchase. The customer information, name and email address will also be saved using ActiveRecord in a table database. 

No special install instructions. Simply run (ruby bin/run.rb) to begin program.
